curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/token/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin@example.com", "password": "your_password"}'

# 2. Create a form schema
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/forms/schemas/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Document Verification",
    "description": "Document verification form",
    "fields_definition": [
      {
        "name": "document_type",

    "phone": "9876543210"
  }'

# 4. Login as employee
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/token/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "employee@example.com", "password": "employee123"}'

# 5. Create form entry
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/forms/entries/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer EMPLOYEE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "form_schema": "SCHEMA_UUID",
    "form_data": {
      "document_type": "Aadhar",
      "document_number": "123456789012"
    }
  }'

# 6. Upload file to form entry
